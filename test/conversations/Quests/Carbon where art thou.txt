ACTIVE:Greetings! I'm looking for a certain magical power that the Alchemists have been searching of for years! Would you like to help me?
ACTIVECY:Brilliant! I've heard it's somewhere in the sewers. Return to me the magical element and I'll reward you nicely.
ACTIVECN:It's okay, my dear fellow. I'll see you later. Come back if you want to help!
STARTED:Did you pick up the magical element that should be somewhere in the Sewers?
STARTEDCN:Keep looking!
STARTEDCYF:Try again!
STARTEDCYT:Brilliant! You've amazed me. I'll make sure the mayor knows of your good deed. In the mean time, I'll break you off a piece.
DONE:You're a great help!
